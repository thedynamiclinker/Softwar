Hi there,

Welcome to the book of humans.

This book is for anyone who feels this way about modern life:

For anyone who feels that abundance makes us poor.

For anyone lonely for something you can't explain why you're lonely for.

The modern world is pretty lonely.

At least for a lot of us.

It's hard to find people you really connect with these days.

People you can really rely on.

A real social safety net.

One built from love and friendship instead of laws and bureaucracy.

As AI moves the world away from full time employment and more toward a gig economy, the thing we each need in order to prevent the new world from becoming a dystopian hellscape is a more tight knit social network.

People we spend our careers with. Who help each other at work. People we pay and get paid by, and teach each other things we know. The parts of human life that modernity is lacking. For more details, see our episode [How to control everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7WRitLqWQc&t=967), from 16:07 to 18:04.

The episodes in this part of the channel will be us hanging out with our favorite people and talking about work and life.

In this book, we gather our people and prepare for war.

Not hard war.

But y'know, business.

Soft war.
