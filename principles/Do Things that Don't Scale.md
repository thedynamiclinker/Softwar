> _Do things that don't scale._
> -Paul Graham

One day in 2024, after I had walked 22 miles in downtown San Diego, I had an sudden craving for a cold fountain drink, of the sugary unhealthy kind one usually finds in fast food joints. I entered a nearby chicken shop to buy one. When I asked for a drink, the young cashier just smiled and said "You're good" and handed me a cup. I told her I wasn't planning to just get water, and I tried to pay. She said "Nah you're good, and smiled again." I told her I didn't mind paying, but she wouldn't let me. She insisted it was free.

This minor act of generosity -- not worrying about a few cents of profit -- so impressed me that I decided this was my kind of place, and I began to go there regularly whenever I was hungry downtown.

The cashier's behavior illustrates a fundamental lesson of business and politics, one which is especially important when you're just getting started.

Do things that don't scale.

Giving away free drinks doesn't scale. It's an absurd thing to advertise openly, to everyone in a large city, with no conditions. But an occasional act of minor generosity, especially if carried out _outside_ of any official corporate policy, attracts loyalty in a way that no product can.
