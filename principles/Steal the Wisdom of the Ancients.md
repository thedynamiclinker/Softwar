Our circumstances may be modern, but our minds are ancient.

And our minds do not come with a natural instinct for life in a large corporation.

There are therefore no principles of team building or management that apply only to life at work.

The principles of coalitional psychology and group dynamics are timeless, found in all cultures, in every discipline from classical literature to war.

This is why we use war as one of the primary models for how to build a team at work.

Not war in the sense of guns and swords and blood and death.

But war in the timeless sense of coalitional coordination in any human activity that involves leadership, alliance, mutiny, brotherhood, mutual aid, strategy, or in other words, life, in any large group of humans, at any time.

These are timeless issues wherever such groups are found.

Should your forces be centralized or distributed?

How large should the subgroups be?

By what principles should they be chosen?

Should leaders be chosen by those above or those below?

How much autonomy should each separate unit be given?

Which subgroups, if any, should the rest be required to obtain permission from before taking an action?

No company handbook can answer these questions effectively except by outsourcing them to the past.

Don't reinvent history.

Steal the wisdom of the ancients.
