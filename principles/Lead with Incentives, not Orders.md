> _"If you want to build a ship, don't drum up people to collect wood and don't assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea."
  -Antoine de Saint Exup√©ry_

Orders are top-down.

Incentives are bottom-up.

Both aim to direct the behavior of others.

Top-down systems require knowledge to be centralized in the individual giving direction.

These systems demand that the manager know more than is known by the sum of all those being managed about the correct low level details of how to carry out the task at hand.

Don't do that.

That's dumb.

So are you.

So am I.

All of us is smarter than any of us.

Build systems that effortlessly take advantage of this, or fail.
