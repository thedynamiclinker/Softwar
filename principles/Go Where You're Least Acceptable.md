NEVER go to the place where it's most ok, and be it.

Go to the place where it's most NOT okay, most unacceptable, most taboo, and be it unapologetically for everyone who's silently hungry for it.

When we hear that a culture is more X, that does NOT mean the people are more X.

Culture doesn't change a thing about individuals. All culture changes is what's acceptable. What's ok. What thoughts you have to hide.
